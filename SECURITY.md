# 🔒 Security Guidelines

## Environment Variables Security

### ✅ What's Protected
- `.env` files are excluded from Git
- All sensitive configuration is in environment variables
- JWT secrets are not hardcoded
- Database credentials are externalized

### 🛡️ Security Checklist

Before pushing to GitHub, ensure:

- [ ] `.env` file is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] JWT secret is strong and unique
- [ ] Database credentials are not in repository
- [ ] API keys are environment variables only
- [ ] No sensitive data in commit history

### 🔐 Environment Variables

**Required for Production:**
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here-make-it-long-and-random
JWT_EXPIRE=7d
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 🚨 Security Best Practices

1. **JWT Secret**: Use a strong, random secret (32+ characters)
2. **Database**: Use MongoDB Atlas with proper security settings
3. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
4. **CORS**: Configure CORS properly for your domain
5. **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding rate limiting for production
6. **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated
7. **Password Hashing**: bcryptjs with salt rounds

### 🔍 Security Audit

Run these commands to check for exposed secrets:

```bash
# Check for hardcoded secrets
grep -r "mongodb://" --exclude-dir=node_modules .
grep -r "jwt.*secret" --exclude-dir=node_modules .
grep -r "password.*=" --exclude-dir=node_modules .

# Check .env is ignored
git check-ignore .env
```

### 🚀 Production Deployment

1. Set environment variables on your hosting platform
2. Use strong, unique JWT secret
3. Enable MongoDB Atlas security features
4. Use HTTPS
5. Set up monitoring and logging
6. Regular security updates

### 📞 Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. Email security concerns privately
3. Include steps to reproduce
4. Wait for acknowledgment before disclosure
